Welcome to üç∞ Dee's Sweet Treats üç∞

We have 'Sweet Treats' to satisfy your sweet tooth.

On the load up you will see three products:
    Toasted Cocunut Cake
    Marble Brownies
    Rocky Road Cookies
Along with a form to create your own 'Sweet Treat'.

Each product has the price, whether the product is gluten-free, and whether the product contains nuts.
You will also see if the product is 'In stock' along with a 'Remove' feature. When the word 'In Stock' is clicked under each product, it will change to 'Out of Stock' and vice versa. When the word 'Remove' is clicked under each product, it will remove said product from the page. 

Bonus: Caloric information for each product is provided below the product when you click on the product picture.

There is also a form to create a new 'Sweet Treat' of your own!
